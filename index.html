    <h1>Why I Like cats?</h1>
    <p>"My favorite pets are cats because they are independent, playful, and full of personality. I love how they can be
        both affectionate and mysterious, curling up on my lap one moment and exploring their surroundings the next.
        Their purring is so calming, and their quirky behavior always brings a smile to my face."</p>
    <h2>Why people don't like black cats?</h2>
    <p>"Many people don't like black cats because of old superstitions that associate them with bad luck or witchcraft.
        These myths have persisted for centuries, often leading to black cats being unfairly feared or avoided. However,
        in reality, black cats are just as loving and playful as any other cat, and many people consider them symbols of
        protection and good fortune."
